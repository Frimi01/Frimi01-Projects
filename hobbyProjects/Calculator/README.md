This is my calculator!

For this project I've used the game Virtual Circuit Board (on steam). And I've used 0 google searches or resources to figure out what to do.

I took each step thinking what i wanted, and with limited knowlage just of what adders were as a concept, made a ton of small goals and thought of them as puzzles. Slowly making componments that might be in a real calculator. I don't know how exactly it replicates real life, but i tried to use the most basic componments of logic gates as much as possible.

Below are some examples of my process through time:

I will add some files so you can import the project yourself to mess with.
