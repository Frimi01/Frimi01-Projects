This is my calculator!

For this project, I've used the game Virtual Circuit Board (on Steam). And I've used 0 Google searches or online resources to determine what to do.

I took each step thinking about what I wanted, and with limited knowledge of things like what adders were as a concept, made a ton of small goals and thought of them as puzzles. Slowly making components that might be in a real calculator. I don't know how exactly it replicates real life, but I tried to use the most basic elements of logic gates as much as possible.

Below are some examples of my process through time:

I will add some files so you can import the project yourself to mess with. I might also make a video sometime on my channel.
