[For more info on 100% COMPLETING SAWKOBAN with the Sawkoban Player](https://ko-fi.com/post/HOW-TO-BEAT-SAWKOBAN-100-B0B119AUZ0?justpublished=true&alias=HOW-TO-BEAT-SAWKOBAN-100-B0B119AUZ0#shareNewPostModal)

The file and code can be seen and downloaded from the repository. 


| Controls:            | Result         |
| -------------------- | -------------- |
| Control + Up arrow   | Next Track     |
| Control + Down arrow | Previous Track |
| Control + Space      | Show Track     |
| Control + Enter      | Play           |
| Control + Q          | Exit           |

The tracks are simply which level you want to play. You can easily see which one you have selected by the small square besides your curser when changing tracks, or by tapping control + space to open a popup.

You can change the ms delay between keypresses on line 186 SetKeyDelay(300, 20) if necessary. 300 being between presses and 20 being the hold duration(The values I set should already be near optimal!). Please leave a comment on github if anything is wrong!

You're free to use and distrobute any code in this program as long as you credit me. I wrote all the code, and I found all the level inputs from [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1468880175) except 118 which I made myself.

## FriBrowse: Minimalistic searching and bookmark solution!
With no ads or distractions, can easily search the web and store your bookmarks in folders!

The bookmarks are saved to a local json so you can't accidentally delete them by clearing or switching your browser! I personally prefer this way of viewing and organizing favorite websites, research materials and notes over the approaches of modern browsers. The appearance is minimalistic (has darkmode) and you can search and add any url with ease!

## frim-convert
A lightweight program for converting and modifying files. Currently, it supports trimming videos using FFmpeg and converting file types (that ffmpeg can change), with plans to add more features like metadata display and additional file operations.

## Friword-finder
A Java CLI tool for finding words through any given dictonaries. It uses several conversions to different datastructures and searching algorythms for speed and efficiency, and serves well as a tool for games (similar to this) https://wordfinder.yourdictionary.com/

It is still in development.

# Minecraft
Projects relating to Minecraft, including mods, texture packs, and worlds.

## Frimi01Mod_prototype
This is a Fabric mod that mostly exists for me to try out different stuff and build different features I might seperate into their own more polished mods later. Not originally intended for collaboration.

# Lightweight Projects
Projects, scripts and files I didn't feel like making it's own repo for:

### 1.  Wallpaper Engine: Improved clock logic with easily modifiable timezones and optional am/pm text. (This should really be default by the editor!)
Add a default clock from the engine and tap on the glowing blue gear icon besides the text field. Tap edit script, and copy paste my code in replacing the default one and click OK. All interactions with the script is in the default ui!

https://github.com/Frimi01/Frimi01-Projects/blob/main/WallpaperEngine/Improved%20Digital%20Clock%20Logic.js 

### 2.  Wallpaper Engine: Analogue clock logic with working Timezone Adjustment!
I added the simple timezone logic and ui to make easy clocks without needing to code. inspired by: [this guy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2107481179)

You can easily go there and add his clock to just import these scripts and get everything out the box. Otherwise you can attach them to anything and have it rotate at the correct rates!

(copy pasting the rotation logic you can easily rotate clocks made by other people for nice aesthetics though that requires a slight bit of manual work)

The opacity script can be used on anything so don't be afraid to be creative and toggle larger changes of sprites and textures in your envirment based on the time! (might add even more flexibility in the future)

### Div_config
1. Wezterm
2. Alacritty (my windows version)
3. Powershell

# Hobby Focused Projects
Less useful projects that I want to share because they're cool.

**1. Simulated Calculator**

Made a calculator by drawing threads and using minimalish logic gates in Virtual Circuit Board. 

https://github.com/Frimi01/Frimi01-Projects/tree/main/hobbyProjects/Calculator

# Ideas for the future
- A simulation "game" to input different maps and output realistic weather and water current simulations. Dynamic simulation, with maybe support for 2d and 3d maps, and maybe some interactable abilities like adding weather events or artificial currents. (particle based)
- Online typing competition game (maybe one that swaps and makes you practice different layouts?)
